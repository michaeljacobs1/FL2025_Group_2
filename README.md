## Objectives
Our project focuses on helping people better understand their financial situation. It works by having users input their projected income over time and then answering questions about their expected expenses. Examples of questions users will answer are: how many kids do you want to have, where do you plan to move, how many homes do you want, and more. Then, based on the users' inputs, a summary of their financial situation over time is provided. When answering questions, users are also allowed to provide as much or as little detail as they desire. Advanced features are also included, such as Monte Carlo simulations and displaying different outcomes based on different investment returns. The tech stack used in this project is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end, accompanied by a MySQL database and Django backend. 


## How to Run
The user will visit the website at <OurWebsiteURL.com> and make an account by setting a username and password. Then, the user will proceed to the first step of inputting their expected income over time, and continue with entering their expected expenses over time. Then, they are given a summary of their financial situation over time, and will be able to adjust sliders for factors such as average investment return, expected inflation rate, etc, to see how it affects their financial situation.
